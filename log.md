# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Build a Personal Porfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Sketched out a design and began work on the top navigation bar and header section.

**Thoughts:** I started this project previously but I quickly hit a block as I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to code what I was seeing in my head. I feel much more confident now after completing a few more courses on Treehouse.

### Day 2: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added the About Me and Project sections and began styling those sections. Made some minor changes to parts of the header as well.

**Thoughts:** It is tough to only spend an hour or so working on this project. I am anxious to get it done and start working on more from freeCodeCamp but I need something to work on for my 100 days so I may as well break this project up into smaller chunks.

### Day 3: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added classes and styles to the Project section so that the examples would float side by side. Changed to overall layout to go with a white background throughout instead of different colors for different sections. Tried to work on the Contact section but couldn't decide on a design I liked.

**Thoughts:** The top part of the page is coming along pretty well but I am not sure what I want to do for the contact page. I tried experimenting with forms but I wasn't happy with the look. I think I am going to go with some text and buttons for contact options like Twitter, GitHub, email etc. but I am not super sold on that idea.

### Day 4: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio page by styling the main-header, about-me, and projects sections.

**Thoughts:** I like how the top parts of the page are turning out, now I just need to figure out the contact section.

### Day 5: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added contact section to Portfolio page and started working on link styles.

**Thoughts:** Project is almost finished. I just need to add links, a footer, and maybe a floating nav bar.
