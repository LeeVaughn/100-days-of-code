# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Build a Personal Porfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Sketched out a design and began work on the top navigation bar and header section.

**Thoughts:** I started this project previously but I quickly hit a block as I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to code what I was seeing in my head. I feel much more confident now after completing a few more courses on Treehouse.

### Day 2: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added the About Me and Project sections and began styling those sections. Made some minor changes to parts of the header as well.

**Thoughts:** It is tough to only spend an hour or so working on this project. I am anxious to get it done and start working on more from freeCodeCamp but I need something to work on for my 100 days so I may as well break this project up into smaller chunks.

### Day 3: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added classes and styles to the Project section so that the examples would float side by side. Changed to overall layout to go with a white background throughout instead of different colors for different sections. Tried to work on the Contact section but couldn't decide on a design I liked.

**Thoughts:** The top part of the page is coming along pretty well but I am not sure what I want to do for the contact page. I tried experimenting with forms but I wasn't happy with the look. I think I am going to go with some text and buttons for contact options like Twitter, GitHub, email etc. but I am not super sold on that idea.

### Day 4: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio page by styling the main-header, about-me, and projects sections.

**Thoughts:** I like how the top parts of the page are turning out, now I just need to figure out the contact section.

### Day 5: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added contact section to Portfolio page and started working on link styles.

**Thoughts:** Project is almost finished. I just need to add links, a footer, and maybe a floating nav bar.

### Day 6: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished by fCC Portfolio Project. I made a ton of changes but some of the highlights include adding links to the top nav bar, adding a floating return to top button using JavaScript, creating a footer, and adding media queries to make the page more responsive to different screen sizes.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out. I look forward to revising the project after I learn more. I am sure the CSS could be streamlined but I was just happy to get everything to work the way I wanted it to.

### Day 7: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made changes/improvements to index.html in main Holiday Trees repository and submitted a Pull Request. The indentation was inconsisted across the various trees, there was an extra closing div at the bottom of the file which was causing one of the trees to not show properly, and a note for where new trees should be added had been removed.

**Thoughts:** I noticed when I added my tree that there were some problems with the file, but I thought I would wait to see if they were fixed when the PR for my tree was merged. The problems continued with new trees so I thought I would make a PR offering a fix.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/mkmckenzie/holiday-trees/pull/10">Pull Request</a> for the holiday-trees repo.

### Day 8: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed an error in my Portfolio project where I inadvertantly removed the padding around the contact for on devices smaller than 768 pixels. Continued working on Basic JavaScript at Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** I have been pleasantly surprised by how easily JavaScript has been going and how much I remember from the first time around.

### Day 9: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on JavaScript. Made a small true/false quiz to practice.

**Thoughts:** I am actually finding myself enjoying JavaScript, which was a far cry from my first experience learning it.

**Link to work:** Link to a <a href="https://twitter.com/DLVProgramming/status/937192149644230656">tweet</a> with a screenshot of the quiz I made.

### Day 10: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript exercise for Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Still going well.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 11: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Basic JavaScript on Treehouse and completed final exercise.

**Thoughts:** Things got a little more complicated once we got into Functions but so far so good.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 12: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day 1 of JavaScript 30, which was to build an drum kit.

**Thoughts:** When I heard about this course that was centered around 30 different JavaScript projects I was excited, but that quickly faded after doing the first project. All of the HTML and CSS is provided for you and you basically just follow along as he ads the JavaScript. For my current level of knowledge is it fairly advanced stuff and there isn't a lot of explaining of what he is doing. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 13: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day 1 of Advent of Code. Thought I had an idea for how to figure out the first puzzle. Turned out I was wrong.

**Thoughts:** I was hoping I could do some of the early days which were supposedly "easier" but they are way more complicated that I am ready for at this time. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 14: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a hot and cold style guessing game to practice my JavaScript. The game will be called "Its Getting Hot in Here!".

**Thoughts:** I was trying to come up with something to practice for JavaScript and I came up with this idea using mainly if/else statements. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/e066d029381eb942783d39d85f406dc5c62d9e4e#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 15: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Hot in Here game.

**Thoughts:** Everything is coming along well but once I learn more I am sure I will find a way to condense the code down into fewer operations. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/29addc649cd27addb4db2a93e2241ca1ba034c41#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 16: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Hot in Here game.

**Thoughts:** Started learning about Switch functions yesterday. I think I might be able to accomplish the same thing easier with Switch functions but at this point I am getting close to finishing the project and I don't want to basically start over. I may try to do a similar project with Switch some other time.

### Day 17: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic version of the hot and cold game.

**Thoughts:** I was able to get the game to work the way I initially planned it. I have few things I would like to tweak but since the purpose of the game was to practice my JavaScript and the JS is finished I will probably wait and work on it once I am able to make a proper HTML interface.

### Day 18: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some JavaScript lessons at fCC.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if the questions just weren't wordly clearly but my brain felt like mush today. Took me much longer to solve problems than is usually does. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/leevaughn">Link</a> to fCC profile showing lessons completed on 12/11.

### Day 19: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Treehouse lessons including a practice exercise to style a website including floats.

**Thoughts:** Been a bit since I did much with CSS but happy to know the info is still in there. Floats used to seem tricky but they are getting easier.

### Day 20: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced styling elements using relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.

**Thoughts:** Positioning elements with CSS is starting to make more and more sense.
