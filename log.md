# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Build a Personal Porfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Sketched out a design and began work on the top navigation bar and header section.

**Thoughts:** I started this project previously but I quickly hit a block as I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to code what I was seeing in my head. I feel much more confident now after completing a few more courses on Treehouse.
