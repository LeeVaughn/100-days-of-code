# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Build a Personal Porfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Sketched out a design and began work on the top navigation bar and header section.

**Thoughts:** I started this project previously but I quickly hit a block as I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to code what I was seeing in my head. I feel much more confident now after completing a few more courses on Treehouse.

### Day 2: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added the About Me and Project sections and began styling those sections. Made some minor changes to parts of the header as well.

**Thoughts:** It is tough to only spend an hour or so working on this project. I am anxious to get it done and start working on more from freeCodeCamp but I need something to work on for my 100 days so I may as well break this project up into smaller chunks.

### Day 3: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added classes and styles to the Project section so that the examples would float side by side. Changed to overall layout to go with a white background throughout instead of different colors for different sections. Tried to work on the Contact section but couldn't decide on a design I liked.

**Thoughts:** The top part of the page is coming along pretty well but I am not sure what I want to do for the contact page. I tried experimenting with forms but I wasn't happy with the look. I think I am going to go with some text and buttons for contact options like Twitter, GitHub, email etc. but I am not super sold on that idea.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/71ca1bbccc342d045ca7232fd80527cc83e6c6e4#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/4f0cd54c76f329f286e1c1d726927603fc93a1d4#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">styles.css</a>

### Day 4: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my portfolio page by styling the main-header, about-me, and projects sections.

**Thoughts:** I like how the top parts of the page are turning out, now I just need to figure out the contact section.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/616003bc8f0950018f301d917df0858461be93be#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/4e4d339311b7c1f51e7e3587c7d83205aa37ff84#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">styles.css</a>

### Day 5: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added contact section to Portfolio page and started working on link styles.

**Thoughts:** Project is almost finished. I just need to add links, a footer, and maybe a floating nav bar.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/8a416b9d64032a98ae72fd2edba2029e3f9fa981#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/7318cc8e1576601188c18ca6f6f09c449bfaab85#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">styles.css</a>

### Day 6: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished by fCC Portfolio Project. I made a ton of changes but some of the highlights include adding links to the top nav bar, adding a floating return to top button using JavaScript, creating a footer, and adding media queries to make the page more responsive to different screen sizes.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I am very happy with how this project turned out. I look forward to revising the project after I learn more. I am sure the CSS could be streamlined but I was just happy to get everything to work the way I wanted it to.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/7a1a382ccea488e8bdfe4b8c823f949c9689e65c#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/72d5e574def074cbb45e1197598593889b4bce45#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">styles.css</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/05d6463e746691506539afd3eab0fbcfcfdeb0c7#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 7: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made changes/improvements to index.html in main Holiday Trees repository and submitted a Pull Request. The indentation was inconsisted across the various trees, there was an extra closing div at the bottom of the file which was causing one of the trees to not show properly, and a note for where new trees should be added had been removed.

**Thoughts:** I noticed when I added my tree that there were some problems with the file, but I thought I would wait to see if they were fixed when the PR for my tree was merged. The problems continued with new trees so I thought I would make a PR offering a fix.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/mkmckenzie/holiday-trees/pull/10">Pull Request</a> for the holiday-trees repo.

### Day 8: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed an error in my Portfolio project where I inadvertantly removed the padding around the contact for on devices smaller than 768 pixels. Continued working on Basic JavaScript at Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** I have been pleasantly surprised by how easily JavaScript has been going and how much I remember from the first time around.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Portfolio-Project/commit/e9f1404cd358107edcdc2570eea8f62395245aac#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">scripts.js</a>

### Day 9: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on JavaScript. Made a small true/false quiz to practice.

**Thoughts:** I am actually finding myself enjoying JavaScript, which was a far cry from my first experience learning it.

**Link to work:** Link to a <a href="https://twitter.com/DLVProgramming/status/937192149644230656">tweet</a> with a screenshot of the quiz I made.

### Day 10: December 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript exercise for Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Still going well.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 11: December 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Basic JavaScript on Treehouse and completed final exercise.

**Thoughts:** Things got a little more complicated once we got into Functions but so far so good.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 12: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day 1 of JavaScript 30, which was to build an drum kit.

**Thoughts:** When I heard about this course that was centered around 30 different JavaScript projects I was excited, but that quickly faded after doing the first project. All of the HTML and CSS is provided for you and you basically just follow along as he ads the JavaScript. For my current level of knowledge is it fairly advanced stuff and there isn't a lot of explaining of what he is doing. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 13: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day 1 of Advent of Code. Thought I had an idea for how to figure out the first puzzle. Turned out I was wrong.

**Thoughts:** I was hoping I could do some of the early days which were supposedly "easier" but they are way more complicated that I am ready for at this time. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 14: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a hot and cold style guessing game to practice my JavaScript. The game will be called "Its Getting Hot in Here!".

**Thoughts:** I was trying to come up with something to practice for JavaScript and I came up with this idea using mainly if/else statements. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/e066d029381eb942783d39d85f406dc5c62d9e4e#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 15: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Hot in Here game.

**Thoughts:** Everything is coming along well but once I learn more I am sure I will find a way to condense the code down into fewer operations. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/29addc649cd27addb4db2a93e2241ca1ba034c41#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 16: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Hot in Here game.

**Thoughts:** Started learning about Switch functions yesterday. I think I might be able to accomplish the same thing easier with Switch functions but at this point I am getting close to finishing the project and I don't want to basically start over. I may try to do a similar project with Switch some other time. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/a0e266538422fa8df2e842a17fff9cef12d9420c#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 17: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic version of the hot and cold game.

**Thoughts:** I was able to get the game to work the way I initially planned it. I have few things I would like to tweak but since the purpose of the game was to practice my JavaScript and the JS is finished I will probably wait and work on it once I am able to make a proper HTML interface. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/Hot-In-Here-Game/commit/7ebcca652a8232b57acd2da826fccd5c21a31a07#diff-db8f629adc6c4c33f29613cfb71a6038">scripts.js</a>

### Day 18: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some JavaScript lessons at fCC.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if the questions just weren't wordly clearly but my brain felt like mush today. Took me much longer to solve problems than is usually does. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/leevaughn">Link</a> to fCC profile showing lessons completed on 12/11.

### Day 19: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Treehouse lessons including a practice exercise to style a website including floats.

**Thoughts:** Been a bit since I did much with CSS but happy to know the info is still in there. Floats used to seem tricky but they are getting easier. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/workspaces/33217872#">Workspace</a>.

### Day 20: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced styling elements using relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.

**Thoughts:** Positioning elements with CSS is starting to make more and more sense. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 21: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an idea I had for Advent of Code. Still no luck.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am close to figuring this one out. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 22: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Object Oriented JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Still happy with the amount of progress I am making with JavaScript the 2nd time around. 

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 23: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the first challenge for the freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting section.

**Thoughts:** Had a couple of days where I only worked on lessons so I didn't count those towards my 100 Days of Code. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/b1f2c5907f40652c345f9f48225f40db1fd26e0f#diff-d23e3b2f4f02e16ff59aaa1d863ad8b8">reverse-string.js</a>

### Day 24: December 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the second challenge for the freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting section. Also ran thru reversing a string again to reinforce the solution and did a little practice with header elements and main nav bars.

**Thoughts:** I had a pretty good idea for how to solve this challenge right from the get go but I did have to look up a few things to refresh my memory. I came up with a solution that returned all the correct answers but for some reason didn't pass the test so I had to come up with another solution that was similar to the first except it counted down instead of counted up. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/2ed930da9cc13db1847346343e7ee90cd905dfdc#diff-ac3407575a09a4102cb0baf0e6fc7d30">factorialize-number.js</a>

### Day 25: December 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the third challenge for the freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting section.

**Thoughts:** I was thrilled at how quickly this one came together. Much of the solution involved reversing a string like we did in the first challenge. From there it was just a matter of figuring out how to remove the non-alphanumeric characters.

### Day 26: December 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 4th Basic Algorithm Challenge from freeCodeCamp, which was to Find the Longest Word in a String. Also practiced some basic Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** I feel like these are going well. I still have to look up a fair bit of the code but at least I know what I am looking for. I do need to work more on functions though as I still don't understand them as well as I would like to. Also worked on Flexbox and practiced some basic designs.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/0fb0fd41598c2297dbab7b3092f04f55e4c98093#diff-a6077855d7d5ebc2dad0d43d892db9e7">longest-word-in-string.js</a>

### Day 27: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 5th of freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithms.

**Thoughts:** I wish I had a better memory so I could do better at solving these without having to look things up but like I said before at least I usually know what it is I want to look up.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/096aebaf26953c81ac2b54d670aecff99b81bbdf#diff-5a4c40ebdb8c0d0965ffbd8d63d10fb8">title-case-sentence.js</a>

### Day 28: December 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 6th of freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithms.

**Thoughts:** This was the first time I did the algorithm without the influence of any outside code. I had to run four different functions to sort the different parts of the arrays so the code isn't as efficient as it probably could be but I was happy to be able to come up with all of the code on my own.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/25f0869b0c01ded8617c1746e6f26b685acad84a#diff-e9d2797a130fdffe1b7f53cd32fb0907">return-largest-numbers.js</a>

### Day 29: December 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the 7th of freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithms. Also worked to improve my solution to the 6th challenge by using a loop.

**Thoughts:** Tried really hard to solve this one again completely on my own. I was really close but I couldn't quite get it to work so I had to resort to a Google search. Turns out I was using the wrong syntax for -target.length in conjuction with .substr. I had the idea right but I wasn't formatting it correctly. I am also right there with the loop for #6 but I can't quite get the last step to work correctly.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/9dec9c0e83b34d1483874cda29ac4573ebf2885b#diff-c39a8aa66335f5fc012eb1a225e59a84">confirm-ending.js</a>

### Day 30: December 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 8th Algorithm in freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm section.

**Thoughts:** Worked on this one for over an hour on my own before finally resorting to Google. I was very close but I was missing the .join() function for the return.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/1b8e4cf19d0db3a62e93eb9da6ffc4ba0de7db5b#diff-6bb8908b2df0e2c157fac887fc3c2b69">repeat-string-repeat-string.js</a>

### Day 31: December 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 9th Algorithm in freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm section.

**Thoughts:** My initial idea was to split the string into individual elements, run a function to compare that string to a length equivilent to num, and then rejoin the string and add "...". Once I realized that num wasn't always a number I knew I needed to go with an If/Else statement.

### Day 32: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted two pull requests and started working on Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

**Thoughts:** Just starting to brush the surface of Python but I am already struck by the similarity to JavaScript and comparable concepts.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/selftaughtprogrammers/FAQ/pull/2">README.md</a> & <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/resources/commit/76a4feb78b5104940f8e5a83ef64c6a55fe473b4#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8">README.md</a>

### Day 33: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 10th fCC Basic Algorithm and worked on Python w/ Automate the Boring Stuff and The Self-Taught Programmer.

**Thoughts:** I still feel like I am right on the edge of being able to figure out these algorithms w/o searching but I seem to always be missing one thing to tie it all together.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/939e513760530cf1943772af31a0a8e66d1383b4#diff-cb9e03033083dcd3841fbf8a916a09ac">chunky-monkey.js</a>

### Day 34: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 11th and 12th freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm.

**Thoughts:** Solved #11 completely on my own but realized after that I made it harder than it had to be by using to different variables to end up with the same number as the original howMany. #12 was harder and I had to resort to Google to figure out how to do the for if loop.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/0e6c049d196f974e3d42f59729946f83f4069b46#diff-875cae5bd17730c46ce144750b85082d">slasher-flick.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/2c81f270b66dafff907bf363fef114337e724424#diff-bdac6481735676e63350e0fc9cc40db4">mutations.js</a>

### Day 35: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 13th freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm.

**Thoughts:** This one ended up being much easier than I thought. I was working on some complexed stuff based on examples related to .filter() but it turns out that I only needed to filter based on boolean.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/98541ed045a6d0b89b42a6216af60372eb777532#diff-2f5dc4d7a8ffff4b0ca11953401537ce">falsey-bouncer.js</a>

### Day 36: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded a solution for the 14th freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm.

**Thoughts:** Happy New Year! This whole series of problems has been a big reminder of how much more I still need to work on my various JavaScript loops.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/4bdec00c6291fa61ebe92007d9be99fb37fbc157#diff-b3bc914660c36b3c7d8afc6af21c3823">seek-destroy.js</a>

### Day 37: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded a solution for the 15th freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I had to look up a few functions but I was happy to have a clear idea of what I needed to do as soon as I read the challenge.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/basic-algorithm-scripting-freecodecamp/commit/ce9a5b7d7ec13bc7cf8e92d7e5bee92382d99269#diff-40bd98597c77b3ed0ef70ef73119b891">where-i-belong.js</a>

### Day 38: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded a solution for the 16th and final freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm. Yay!

**Thoughts:** This one was super hard for me. I read up on the recommended functions but it still wasn't clear what numbers corresponded to what letters. Even once I started looking at solution that connection wasn't clear. It wasn't until I read <a href="http://www.seth-dehaan.com/2016/01/21/freecodecamp-caesar-s-cipher/">this article</a> that I really understood the ASCII codes and how to solve the problem.

### Day 39: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Started designing and gathering quotes for my random quote generator project.

**Thoughts:** My plan is to make a Heroes of the Storm themed quote generator.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 40: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Began intial work on my random quote machine project. Did some basic HTML and CSS and started working on the quote array.

**Thoughts:** I've been focusing on JavaScript so much recently I am going to need to go back and brush up on my Flexbox to finish the layout.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/random-quote-machine">Random Quote Machine repo</a>

### Day 41: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Pretty much finished up the HTML and CSS for my Random Quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Had to brush up a bit on Flexbox but I pretty much have the page displaying the way that I would like. Now I just need to finish up the array, add the scripts to randomly pick a quote, and then tie it in with the button on the page.

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/random-quote-machine/commit/bdc39de42e2198d025e60f2a5ac778a440d28f6e#diff-eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b">index.html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeeVaughn/random-quote-machine/commit/7fbf4d65b0de2795c9d843650a699ee2fb145ced#diff-4e7bb40584b55a44f4657b188986bff4">styles.css</a>

### Day 42: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added some HTML and CSS to allow the option to Tweet quotes. Finished adding the different quotes to the array.

**Thoughts:** Just need to add a few Blaze quotes and then work on the functionality for the quote generator and tweet sharing.

### Day 43: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a new logo, changed some styles to to accomodate the new logo, and started working on the function to randomize quotes.

**Thoughts:** I am getting an error message when I try to generate a quote that appears to be related to the jquery library. I will have to sort that out tomorrow.

### Day 44: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my Quotes of the Storm project including adding the option to share quotes via Twitter and generating the first quote and source upon page load.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy with how this project came out. I would have like to have completed it sooner but this cold slowed me down quite a bit the last couple days.
