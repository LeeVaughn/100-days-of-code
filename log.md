# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Build a Personal Porfolio project for freeCodeCamp. Sketched out a design and began work on the top navigation bar and header section.

**Thoughts:** I started this project previously but I quickly hit a block as I didn't feel like I had the knowledge to code what I was seeing in my head. I feel much more confident now after completing a few more courses on Treehouse.

### Day 2: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my Portfolio page. Added the About Me and Project sections and began styling those sections. Made some minor changes to parts of the header as well.

**Thoughts:** It is tough to only spend an hour or so working on this project. I am anxious to get it done and start working on more from freeCodeCamp but I need something to work on for my 100 days so I may as well break this project up into smaller chunks.
